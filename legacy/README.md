This folder contains legacy/unused code that is not part of the current app runtime.

- `legacy/admin/` contains an older admin UI implementation based on `services/mockBackend`.
- `legacy/customer/` contains older “barrel export” helpers.

Keeping these files here avoids confusion in the main project folders.
